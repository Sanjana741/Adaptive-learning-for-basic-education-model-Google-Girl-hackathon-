Fundamental Education Problem: One-Size-Fits-All Doesn't Work<br><br/>
Traditional education often holds students back by using a one-size-fits-all approach. This rigid system must acknowledge the vast differences in learning styles, paces, and prior knowledge that students bring to the classroom. It struggles to cater to individual student needs, and lack of individualization leads to a vicious cycle of frustration, disengagement, and uneven learning. This passive learning hinders their academic progress and can cultivate a dislike for learning altogether.<br/>

<br/>
Solution: Personalized Learning with a Virtual Tutor<br/><br/>
The Virtual Tutor platform has the potential to revolutionize primary education by providing a personalized and
engaging learning experience for all students. By leveraging adaptive learning technologies,  this platform can 
empower students to take ownership of their learning and achieve academic success. Our virtual platform moves beyond relying solely on exercise scores. Instead, it utilizes a richer data pool that includes quizzes, interaction patterns, and student confidence levels. This comprehensive approach allows for a multi-faceted assessment that combines adaptive questioning, skill-based challenges, and real-time feedback. This information then fuels a personalized learning journey for each student, offering various content, targeted practice, and dynamically adjusted difficulty levels. This holistic approach ensures an engaging and practical learning experience that caters to each student's unique needs.

Environment used for the running code:<br/>
We can run the code in Google Colab(https://colab.research.google.com/). The main.py file is used to execute the model and predict the student's ability. In the given code, I have used sample data, but we can replace it with the data file provided in the library or uploaded in a folder and test the model. It will predict the level of the student in that course, and then we can adjust their learning path accordingly.
